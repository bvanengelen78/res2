# Dashboard KPI Analysis - Current Implementation

## Overview
This document analyzes the existing dashboard KPIs and functionality to ensure all critical metrics are preserved and enhanced in the new blue-themed dashboard.

## Core KPI Cards (4 Primary Metrics)

### 1. Active Projects
- **Value**: Number of projects currently in active status
- **Icon**: ProjectorIcon

- **Trend**: Stable
- **Status**: Info

### 2. Available Resources
- **Value**: Resources with utilization below 100% capacity
- **Icon**: Users
- **Color**: Green (bg-green-100 text-green-600 border-green-200)
- **Tooltip**: "Resources with utilization below 100% capacity"
- **Trend**: Stable
- **Status**: Good

### 3. Capacity Conflicts
- **Value**: Resources allocated over 100% capacity
- **Icon**: AlertTriangle
- **Color**: Dynamic based on conflict count
  - 0 conflicts: Green
  - 1-2 conflicts: Yellow/Warning
  - 3+ conflicts: Red/Critical
- **Tooltip**: "Resources allocated over 100% capacity"
- **Trend**: Dynamic (up/down/stable)
- **Status**: Dynamic (good/warning/critical)

### 4. Utilization Rate
- **Value**: Average resource utilization percentage across all active resources
- **Icon**: TrendingUp
- **Color**: Dynamic based on utilization
  - <70%: Yellow (underutilized)
  - 70-90%: Green (optimal)
  - >90%: Red (overutilized)
- **Tooltip**: "Average resource utilization across all active resources"
- **Trend**: Dynamic
- **Status**: Dynamic

## Enhanced Capacity Alerts

### Alert Categories
1. **Overallocated Resources** (>100% capacity)
2. **Near Capacity Resources** (85-100% capacity)
3. **Underutilized Resources** (<70% capacity)
4. **Unassigned Resources** (0% allocation)

### Alert Features
- Grouped by category for better organization
- Color-coded severity levels (Critical, Warning, Info)

- Shows available capacity hours
- Identifies skill sets not being fully utilized
- Provides optimization recommendations

### Critical Overlaps
- Detects multi-project resource conflicts
- Assesses risk levels for each overlap
- Shows project priority conflicts
- Provides resolution suggestions

## Smart Notifications Panel

### Predictive Alerts
- **Capacity Alerts**: 7+ day forecasting
- **Deadline Alerts**: Project timeline risks
- **Resource Alerts**: Availability conflicts
- Severity levels: Critical, Warning, Info
- Days ahead indicators

### Deadline Health Scoring
- Project health assessment (on-track, at-risk, behind)
- Progress gap analysis
- Risk factor identification
- Days remaining calculations
- Traffic light status indicators

## Role & Skill Heatmap

### Role Clusters
- Groups resources by role/department
- Shows total capacity vs allocated hours
- Calculates average utilization per role
- Identifies role-based gaps and surpluses

### Weekly Availability Forecast
- 8-week forward-looking capacity view
- Role-based availability heatmap
- Color-coded availability status
- Capacity planning insights

### Gap Analysis
- Shortage/surplus calculations per role
- Recommendations for resource optimization
- Skill set distribution analysis

## Hours Allocation vs Actual

### Time Tracking Analysis
- Compares allocated vs actual hours
- Variance calculations and percentages
- Resource utilization tracking
- Project performance metrics

### Status Indicators
- On-track: ±10% variance
- Over: >10% over allocation
- Under: >10% under allocation

## Time Logging Reminder

### Features
- Shows resources with missing time entries
- Displays current week logging status
- Provides quick navigation to time logging
- Highlights overdue submissions

## Quick Actions

### Available Actions
1. **Create Project**: Opens project creation form
2. **Add Resource**: Opens resource creation form
3. **Generate Report**: Placeholder for report generation
