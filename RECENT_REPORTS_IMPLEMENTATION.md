## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### Frontend Components
```
client/src/pages/reports.tsx                             # Enhanced reports page
client/src/components/change-allocation-report-modal.tsx # Updated modal
```

### Backend Implementation
```
server/routes.ts                                         # New API endpoints
server/storage.ts                                        # Database methods
shared/schema.ts                                         # Database schema
```

### Database Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE recent_reports (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    type TEXT NOT NULL,
    generated_by INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    generated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW() NOT NULL,
    size TEXT,
    criteria JSONB,
    download_url TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

## ðŸš€ API Endpoints

### Recent Reports Management
- `GET /api/reports/recent` - Fetch user's recent reports
- `POST /api/reports/recent` - Add new report to recent list
- `DELETE /api/reports/recent/:id` - Delete specific report
- `DELETE /api/reports/recent` - Clear all user's reports

## ðŸ“‹ Database Setup Required

**IMPORTANT**: You need to run the database migration to create the `recent_reports` table:

### Option 1: Manual SQL Execution
Run this SQL in your Supabase SQL editor:

```sql
-- Create the recent_reports table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS recent_reports (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    type TEXT NOT NULL,
    generated_by INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    generated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW() NOT NULL,
    size TEXT,
    criteria JSONB,
    download_url TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Create indexes for better performance
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_recent_reports_generated_by ON recent_reports(generated_by);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_recent_reports_generated_at ON recent_reports(generated_at DESC);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_recent_reports_type ON recent_reports(type);

-- Grant necessary permissions
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON recent_reports TO authenticated;
GRANT USAGE, SELECT ON SEQUENCE recent_reports_id_seq TO authenticated;
```

### Option 2: Use Migration File
The migration file is available at: `migrations/add_recent_reports_table.sql`
