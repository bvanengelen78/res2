# Resource Allocation Row Locking Implementation

## Problem Solved
Fixed the UX issue where table rows were dynamically reordering during hour entry, causing a disruptive editing experience. Users can now edit allocation values without rows jumping to different positions.

## Solution Overview
Implemented an "editing session" mechanism that locks row order during active editing:

### Key Features
1. **Automatic Session Detection**: Editing session starts automatically on first cell edit
2. **Stable Row Order**: Rows maintain their positions during editing regardless of value changes
3. **Session Auto-End**: Session ends automatically after 2 seconds of inactivity
4. **Visual Feedback**: Shows "Row order locked during editing" indicator when active
5. **Data Consistency**: Totals and calculations still reflect real-time data

## Implementation Details

### State Management
```typescript
// State for locking row order during editing
const [isEditingSession, setIsEditingSession] = useState(false);
const [lockedRowOrder, setLockedRowOrder] = useState<AllocationWithResource[]>([]);
```

### Stable Allocations Logic
```typescript
// Stable row order during editing sessions
const stableAllocations = useMemo(() => {
  if (isEditingSession && lockedRowOrder.length > 0) {
    // During editing, maintain the locked order but update with current data
    return lockedRowOrder.map(lockedAllocation => {
      const currentAllocation = filteredAllocations.find(
        a => a.id === lockedAllocation.id
      );
      return currentAllocation || lockedAllocation;
    }).filter(allocation => 
      // Only keep allocations that still match current filters
      filteredAllocations.some(fa => fa.id === allocation.id)
    );
  }
  return filteredAllocations;
}, [isEditingSession, lockedRowOrder, filteredAllocations]);
```

### Session Management
- **Start**: Triggered on first cell edit
- **End**: Triggered after 2 seconds of no pending changes
- **Lock**: Captures current row order when session starts
- **Unlock**: Clears locked order when session ends

## Files Modified

### 1. Project Resource Allocation Table
- `client/src/components/project-resource-allocation-table.tsx`
- Added editing session state and management
- Replaced `filteredAllocations` with `stableAllocations` in rendering logic
- Added visual indicator for locked state

### 2. Resource Weekly Allocation Table  
- `client/src/components/resource-weekly-allocation-table.tsx`
- Added editing session state and management
- Replaced `activeAllocations` with `stableAllocations` in rendering logic
- Added visual indicator for locked state

## User Experience Improvements

### Before
- Rows would reorder immediately when values changed
- Users lost their place during multi-cell editing
- Difficult to navigate between related cells
- Disruptive editing experience

### After
- Rows maintain stable positions during editing
- Users can efficiently edit multiple cells in sequence
- Keyboard navigation works predictably
- Smooth, professional editing experience
- Visual feedback shows when row order is locked

## Technical Benefits

1. **Non-Breaking**: Existing functionality remains unchanged
2. **Performance**: Minimal overhead, only active during editing
3. **Compatibility**: Works with existing keyboard navigation
4. **Flexibility**: Automatically adapts to filtering changes
5. **Reliability**: Handles edge cases like filter changes during editing

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Basic Editing**: Verify rows don't reorder during value entry
2. **Multi-Cell Editing**: Test editing multiple cells in sequence
3. **Keyboard Navigation**: Ensure arrow keys work correctly during locked state
4. **Filter Changes**: Test behavior when filters change during editing
5. **Session Timeout**: Verify automatic session end after inactivity
6. **Visual Indicators**: Confirm lock indicator appears/disappears correctly

## Future Enhancements

1. **Manual Lock Toggle**: Add button to manually lock/unlock row order
2. **Session Persistence**: Remember locked state across page refreshes
3. **Bulk Edit Mode**: Extended locking for bulk operations
4. **Custom Timeout**: User-configurable session timeout duration
