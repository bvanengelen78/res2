## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### File Changes
```typescript
// client/src/pages/dashboard.tsx
// REMOVED:
import { ActionableInsightsPanel } from "@/components/actionable-insights-panel";

// REMOVED:
<ExpandableWidget title="Actionable Insights" ...>
  <ActionableInsightsPanel resources={resources || []} alerts={alerts} />
</ExpandableWidget>
```

### Preserved Architecture
```typescript
// client/src/hooks/useUntappedPotential.ts - PRESERVED
export function useUntappedPotential(resources, alerts, options) {
  // All logic preserved for Enhanced Capacity Alerts
}

// client/src/components/enhanced-capacity-alerts.tsx - UNCHANGED
const { asAlertResources: untappedResources, count: untappedCount } = useUntappedPotential(
  resources, alerts, { utilizationThreshold: 70, minimumCapacity: 35 }
