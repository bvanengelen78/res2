Successfully implemented three quick win features for the Change Lead Reports page to improve usability for change leads:

1. **Project Filtering with Favorites** ⭐
2. **Inline Row Comments/Notes** 📝
3. **Automatic Variance Highlighting** 🎨

## 🚀 Features Implemented

### 1. Project Filtering with Favorites ⭐

**What it does:**
- Adds star/pin icons next to each project in the project dropdown filter
- Allows users to mark projects as "favorites" for quick access
- Groups the dropdown to show "Favorites" at the top, then "All Projects" below
- Stores favorite preferences in the database

**Key Components:**
- Star/StarOff icons with hover effects
- Organized dropdown with sections
- Real-time favorite toggling
- Database persistence via new `user_project_favorites` table

### 2. Inline Row Comments/Notes 📝

**What it does:**
- Adds a new "Notes" column to the effort summary table
- Enables inline editing with a clean textarea interface
- Allows change leads to add contextual notes like "Approved overtime" or "Deviation due to illness"
- Stores notes in the database and displays them in the table

**Key Components:**
- Inline editing with Save/Cancel buttons
- Hover-to-edit functionality
- Database persistence via new `effort_summary_notes` table

### 3. Automatic Variance Highlighting 🎨

**What it does:**
- Implements visual highlighting for rows with significant variance
- Uses color coding: red for >20% over-allocation, blue for under-allocation
- Applies highlighting to the entire table row, not just the variance column
- Adds visual indicators (icons) alongside the color coding

**Key Components:**
- Row-level color highlighting based on variance percentage
- Border indicators for high-variance items
- Icons in variance column (AlertCircle, TrendingUp, TrendingDown)
- Smooth transitions and hover effects

## 📊 Variance Highlighting Levels

|---------------|-------|--------|------|-------------|
| High Over (>20%) | Red background | Red left border | AlertCircle | Significant over-allocation |
| High Under (>20%) | Blue background | Blue left border | AlertCircle | Significant under-allocation |
| Medium Over (10-20%) | Orange background | Orange left border | TrendingUp | Moderate over-allocation |
| Medium Under (10-20%) | Cyan background | Cyan left border | TrendingDown | Moderate under-allocation |
| Low (<10%) | Default | None | None | Within acceptable range |
