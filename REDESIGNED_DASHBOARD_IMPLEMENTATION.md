## üìä Actionable Insights Examples

### Harold Lunenburg Use Case - SOLVED
**Before Redesign:**
- Static capacity display showing 200% utilization
- No immediate action guidance
- Manual analysis required to understand impact

**After Redesign:**
- **Top 3 Bottlenecks**: Harold identified as critical bottleneck
- **Severity**: Critical (200% utilization)
- **Impact**: "Blocking 2 high-priority projects"
- **Action**: "Immediate reallocation required"
- **Navigation**: Direct link to `/resources/17#allocations`

### Smart Notifications Examples
- **Predictive Alert**: "Harold will exceed capacity next sprint (Current: 200% ‚Üí Predicted: 215%)"
- **Deadline Health**: "Project Alpha is 25% behind expected progress (Risk of missing deadline in 14 days)"
- **Resource Overlap**: "Kees Steijsiger assigned to 3 concurrent high-priority projects"

### Role & Skill Heatmap Insights
- **DevOps Shortage**: "Need 2 additional DevOps resources (40h shortage)"
- **Frontend Surplus**: "3 Frontend resources available for new projects (120h surplus)"
- **Weekly Forecast**: "No available DevOps next 2 weeks (100% utilization)"
