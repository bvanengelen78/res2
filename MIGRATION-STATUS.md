- [⚠️] TypeScript compilation has pre-existing errors (not migration-related)
- [⏳] Database connectivity testing pending (requires Supabase setup)

## 📋 Next Steps for User

### 1. Set Up Supabase Project
1. Create a new Supabase project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Get your project credentials:
   - Project URL
   - Anon key
   - Database connection string
3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your credentials

### 2. Initialize Database Schema
1. Open Supabase SQL Editor
2. Run the contents of `supabase-migration.sql`
3. Verify all tables are created successfully

### 3. Test Application
```bash
# Install dependencies (if not already done)
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

### 4. Address TypeScript Issues (Optional)
The application has pre-existing TypeScript errors that don't prevent it from running but should be addressed for production:
- Type mismatches in form handling
- Missing properties in API responses
- Null/undefined handling improvements
