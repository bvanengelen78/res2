# Dashboard Generate Report Modal Test

## Test Steps

1. **Navigate to Dashboard**
   - Open http://localhost:5000/dashboard
   - Verify the page loads successfully

2. **Locate Quick Actions Section**
   - Scroll down to find the "Quick Actions" section
   - Verify there are three action cards: "Create New Project", "Add Resource", and "Generate Report"

3. **Test Generate Report Button**
   - Click on the "Generate Report" action card
   - Verify that the Change Allocation Report modal opens
   - The modal should have the title "Generate Change Allocation Report"

4. **Verify Modal Functionality**
   - Check that the modal contains:
     - Time Range section with Start Date and End Date inputs
     - Projects (Changes) section with checkboxes
     - Resources (Optional) section with checkboxes
     - Group By dropdown
     - Cancel and Generate Report buttons

5. **Test Modal Closing**
   - Click "Cancel" to close the modal
   - Click the "X" button to close the modal
   - Click outside the modal to close it

## Expected Behavior

- ✅ The Generate Report button should open the modal instead of navigating to a new page
- ✅ The modal should be the same one used in the Reports page
- ✅ All functionality should work identically to the Reports page implementation
- ✅ The modal should close properly when dismissed

## Implementation Details

### Changes Made:
1. **Dashboard Component (`client/src/pages/dashboard.tsx`)**:
   - Added import for `ChangeAllocationReportModal`
   - Added state management: `changeAllocationModalOpen`, `setChangeAllocationModalOpen`
   - Updated `onGenerateReport` handler to open modal instead of console.log
   - Added `ChangeAllocationReportModal` component at the end

2. **No Changes Required to**:
   - `QuickActions` component (already accepts function handlers)
   - `ChangeAllocationReportModal` component (reused as-is)
   - Reports page functionality (unchanged)

### Benefits:
- ✅ Consistent user experience across the application
- ✅ No page navigation required for report generation
- ✅ Reuses existing, tested modal component
- ✅ Maintains all existing functionality and styling
