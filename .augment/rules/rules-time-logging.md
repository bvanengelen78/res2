# Time Logging Rules

1. Resources must log time per project, per day.
2. Time can be saved incrementally; only submitted weeks are locked.
3. Weekends are disabled by default â€” users must toggle to enable.
4. Submission status is required for compliance tracking.
5. Users must be able to unsubmit a week if corrections are needed.
6. Time logging views should be optimized for mobile and keyboard input.
7. Weekly summary cards must reflect the real status (logged, submitted).
